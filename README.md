## Description
This project will aim to build a high speed and accurate pick and place machine using bldc motors as servo's, automatic feeders and vision. Currently work is being done on developing component feeders.

## Features
- __Automatic component feeders:__
  - Designed for use of tape with 8mm Tape and Reel specifications.
  - Uses a 40x40mm aluminium profile as rail for mounting with integrated usb port for automatic powering and communication with the feeders.
  - Capable of accepting 20 feeders on a 500mm long aluminium profile.
  - SMT Reel holder which makes use of full sized reels convenient.
  - Handle for ease of insertion/removal from aluminium rail.
  - UART over RS485 for easy and reliable communication with the feeders. This means all feeders are controllable using a single USB port with use of a USB-RS485 converter.
  - Two buttons for manual control of the motor driving the tape forwards and backwards.
  - RGB Status LED provides the user with the current status of each feeder.
  - Integrated IR sensor as rotary encoder for accurate repeatability of the motors movement.
  - Automatically and mechanically peels tape based on the movement of the tape itself to reduce complexity and part count.
